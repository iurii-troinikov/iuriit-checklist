<h3>Symfony Todo API</h3> 
Hello my dear friend!<br>
I would like to invite you to consider my application!<br>
<h4>For the developer:</h4>
The app is written in php using symfony and bootstrap frameworks. To deploy my project on your local computer you have to do a composer install.<br>
<h4>For the user:</h4>
This app is designed for you to look at your task list every day and remember to do them! The app allows you to mark already completed tasks, create new ones and delete old ones. You can see the demo version here https://iuriit.allbugs.info/checklist
